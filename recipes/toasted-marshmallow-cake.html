                <li>1 ⅔ cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>½ cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
                <li>½ cup white sugar</li> 
                <li>3 tablespoons marshmallow creme</li>
                <li>3 large egg whites, at room temperature</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon almond extract</li>
                <li>⅔ cup buttermilk</li>

            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven's broiler and place an oven rack a few inches below it. Line a baking<br> sheet with parchment paper and lightly grease the parchment.</li> <br>
                <li>Spread out mini marshmallows on the baking sheet in an even layer, and put under<br> the broiler until browned and toasted, about 30 seconds. Remove from heat and<br> allow to cool.</li> <br>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) and place an oven rack in the<br> middle of the oven. Line a 9-inch round cake pan with parchment paper and lightly<br> grease it.</li> <br>
                <li>Whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt in a small bowl.</li> <br>
                <li>Cream together toasted mini marshmallows, butter, oil, sugar, and marshmallow crème<br> in a large bowl with an electric mixer until thoroughly incorporated and smooth,<br> 2 to 3 minutes. Beat in egg whites, 1 at a time, mixing well after each addition.<br> Mix in vanilla and almond extracts. Stir in half of the flour mixture until just combined.<br> Mix in buttermilk until just combined. Stir in remaining flour<br> mixture until just combined.</li> <br>
                <li>Pour batter into the prepared cake pan, and spread into an even layer.</li> <br>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the top springs back lightly when touched, 35 to 40<br> minutes. Allow cake to cool in the pan for 10 to 15 minutes before transferring to a<br> wire rack to cool completely.</li> <br>
                   
            </ol>
