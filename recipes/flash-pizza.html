    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>Dough:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups self-rising flour, or more as needed</li>
                <li>1 ½ teaspoons white sugar</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                <li>1 cup plain Greek yogurt</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon water, or as needed (Optional)</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Toppings:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>2 tablespoons cornmeal, divided</li>
                <li>⅔ cup pizza sauce, divided</li>
                <li>8 ounces low-moisture mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
                <li>¼ cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, divided</li>
                <li>26 slices pepperoni, divided</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons olive oil, divided</li>
            </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix 2 cups self-rising flour, sugar, and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese for dough in a<br> bowl until well combined. Add olive oil and Greek yogurt and mix with a spoon until a<br> shaggy dough forms. Clean off the spoon and mix the dough with your hands until it<br> mostly comes together.</li><br>
            <li>Transfer dough to a work surface and continue pushing it together until it smooths<br> out. It will be dry; don't be tempted yet to add more liquid. Knead dough until<br> smooth and elastic, 3 to 4 minutes, only adding a teaspoon or two of water or flour if<br> absolutely necessary. Cut dough into two equal pieces.</li><br>
            <li>Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and sprinkle 1 tablespoon<br> cornmeal over the surface.</li><br>
            <li>Roll one piece dough on a lightly floured surface to an 1/8-inch-thick rectangle.<br> Transfer to the prepared baking sheet.</li><br>
            <li>Top dough with ½ of the pizza sauce, spreading it almost, but not quite all the way, to<br> the edges. Sprinkle ½ of the mozzarella over the sauce, then ½ of the Parmigiano-<br>Reggiano over top. Arrange ½ of the pepperoni slices over the cheese, then drizzle 1<br> teaspoon oil over top.</li><br>
            <li>Bake in the center of the preheated oven until crust is beautifully browned and<br> toppings are bubbly, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let sit for 5<br> minutes before slicing and serving.</li><br>
            <li>As soon as you remove the pizza from the oven, repeat Steps 3 to 6 to top and bake<br> second pizza.</li>
        </ol>
